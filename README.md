# TrueLayer
Script requested by TrueLayer

Write a simple script using a language of your choice (bash is also accepted, avoid Powershell) that:  
•	Creates a folder in your home directory called TrueLayer.  
•	Creates a file in the TrueLayer folder called TLTest.txt.  
•	Dumps into the file:  
o	The time when the script has been run  
o	The name of the script file  
o	The full list of every file and folder name present in the running folder.  
o	The public IP the machine uses to reach internet,  
o	The ram available in MB  
o	The PID and the name of the user that is executing the script  
•	If the script is run multiple times, it shouldn’t fail and has to append all the information in the file, separating each run with a comment.
